If you have a question that you can't find in here, feel free to create an issue for it and we'll add it shortly.


### What is Quantum Computing?

> Quantum Computing is a paradigm in computational theory which makes use of quantum mechanical 
> properties in order to solve *certain* problems more efficiently in comparison to existing classical methods. 

We can also define Quantum Computing without making any comparison to classical computing: 
> Quantum Computing is a computational paradigm which evaluates computational problems by exploiting
> quantum-mechanical properties in order to process states simulatneously and filtering out the solutions.
